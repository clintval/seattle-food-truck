<h3 align="center">Installation</h3>

```bash
❯ pip install seattle-food-truck
```

<h3 align="center">Tutorial</h3>

The `Client` allows you to discover convenient or nearby locations where food trucks are scheduled to visit! After finding a suitable `Location` we can query it for a schedule of trucks.

```python
from seattle_food_truck import Client

sft = Client()
```

You can discover locations through listing them all. All locations are memoized once they are discovered to speedup all future queries.

```python
print(f'There are {len(sft.locations)} locations.\n')
print(sft.locations)
```

```
There are 300 locations.

[
  Location(name="10109 Lakewood Towne Center Boulevard Southwest, Lakewood, WA, USA", address="10109 Lakewood Towne Center Boulevard Southwest, Lakewood, WA, USA", uid=377),
  Location(name="110 9th Avenue So
  uthwest, Puyallup, WA, USA", address="110 9th Avenue Southwest, Puyallup, WA, USA", uid=375),
  Location(name="11211 Main Street, Bellevue, WA, USA", address="11211 Main Street, Bellevue, WA, USA", uid=368),
  Location(name="1201 Main Street, Sumner, WA, USA", address="1201 Main Street, Sumner, WA, USA", uid=382),
  Location(name="1208 10th St, Snohomish, WA, USA", address="1208 10th St, Snohomish, WA, USA", uid=390),
  Location(name="1208 10th Street, Snohomish, WA, USA", address="1208 10th Street, Snohomish, WA, USA", uid=397),
  ...
]
```

It would be easier if we could sort the list of locations by their proximity to my home or job site!
The `Client` provides two functions for this purpose.

The first discovers all locations ranked by their direct distance away.

```python
address = '3131 Elliott Ave Seattle WA 98121'

for distance, location in sft.locations_closest_to(address):
    print(f'{distance:0.2f} miles away: {location.name}
    print('\t' + location.address)
```

```
0.11 miles away: PI Building
    101 Elliott Ave W, Seattle, WA, United States
0.27 miles away: Olympic Sculpture Park
    2901 Western Avenue, Seattle, WA, United States
0.43 miles away: F5 Networks
    401 Elliott Ave W, Seattle, WA 98119, United States
0.66 miles away: Memorial Stadium
    401 5th Avenue North, Seattle, WA, United States
...
```

The second simply returns the location nearest to me.

```python
location = sft.nearest_location_to(address)

for truck in location.trucks_today():
    print(truck)
```

```
Truck("NOSH", style="Seafood")
Truck("Raney Brothers BBQ", style="BBQ")
```
